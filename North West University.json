These \nequations are fundamental to our understanding of all electromagnetic phenomena. \n• Students proceed to master and evaluate solutions to these equations in various scenarios, such as \nfor dielectrics, conductors, waveguides, and optical fibres, and resolve complex problems related to \nthese applications by identifying, selecting and applying the correct problem-solving techniques. \n• Furthermore, basic research skills will be acquired and applied in the practical component of this \ncourse, where some aspects of electromagnetism are experimentally investigated. Here students will\nconduct experiments effectively which measure basic observable quantities related to special and \ncontrolled cases of natural processes, processing and critically evaluating the data so acquired. \n• Students will learn how to reliably demonstrate, develop and communicate discipline-specific ideas \nby planning and writing experimental reports in an accurate and coherent way, while respecting \nconventions related to copyright and plagiarism and taking full responsibility for their work with \nregards to this, thereby gaining valuable scientific writing skills."
